      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Understanding Your Bankruptcy Options in Avondale</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bankruptcy is a legal mechanism that can either eliminate or restructure certain types of debt. Two of the most common chapters for individuals are **Chapter 7** and **Chapter 13**. While both provide substantial relief, the approach differs in important ways:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</strong> – Often called “liquidation bankruptcy,” Chapter 7 offers a quick method to eliminate most unsecured debts. Common examples include credit card balances, medical bills, and personal loans. Although there is a concern that property could be sold to repay creditors, Arizona state exemptions can shield essential assets like your home (up to a specific equity limit) and your vehicle, provided it doesn’t exceed certain value thresholds. If your income is below the state median (as determined by the <em>Means Test</em>), you may qualify for Chapter 7 in Avondale.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</strong> – Known as a “wage earner’s plan,” Chapter 13 is designed for those who have a steady income but need more time to catch up on overdue payments, such as a mortgage or car loan. This option allows you to consolidate and reorganize debts into a three-to-five-year repayment schedule. It can be a powerful tool if you have significant equity in your home or if you’re behind on car payments and want to avoid repossession. After you complete the repayment plan, any remaining eligible unsecured debt is discharged.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Who Qualifies for Bankruptcy in Avondale?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The decision to file for bankruptcy depends on your income, the nature of your debts, and your financial goals. For **Chapter 7**, the <em>Means Test</em> compares your household income to Arizona’s median. If you earn less than the median, you’re more likely to qualify for Chapter 7. However, even if you exceed the median income, you might still be eligible by factoring in specific monthly expenses or by opting for **Chapter 13**. In Chapter 13, you need sufficient disposable income to fund a repayment plan. Our attorneys analyze your full financial picture—taking into account monthly bills, secured debts, and future income projections—to determine the best course of action.

        <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How do I know if I qualify for bankruptcy in Avondale?</summary>
        <p className="mt-2">
          If you plan to pursue Chapter 7, you must generally pass the **Arizona Means Test**, which checks whether your income is at or below the state median. Chapter 13 requires sufficient regular income to manage monthly expenses while funding a structured repayment plan. Our legal team can help you evaluate both options.

      <details className="border rounded-md p-4 my-4">
        <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How long does bankruptcy take?</summary>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Chapter 7 bankruptcy** often concludes within **3-6 months**, providing a relatively quick resolution. **Chapter 13**, by contrast, spans **3-5 years** because it involves a court-approved repayment plan. The duration depends on your case’s complexity and how promptly you submit any required documentation.

      <details className="border rounded-md p-4 my-4">
        <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Does filing for bankruptcy stop creditors from calling?</summary>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Yes. Once you file for bankruptcy, an <strong>automatic stay</strong> is issued by the court, halting most collection efforts, including wage garnishments, lawsuits, and relentless phone calls. While there are exceptions for certain debts—like child support or criminal fines—the stay generally provides immediate relief from creditor harassment.
