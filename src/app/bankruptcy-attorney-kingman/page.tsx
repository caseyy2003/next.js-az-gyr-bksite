      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</strong> – A process that eliminates most unsecured debts, such as credit card balances and medical bills, giving you a financial reset.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</strong> – Allows individuals with regular income to develop a structured repayment plan, preventing foreclosure and repossession.</li>
      </ul>
