      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Understanding Your Bankruptcy Options</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Personal bankruptcy generally falls under two major chapters: **Chapter 7** and **Chapter 13**. Each chapter addresses different financial situations and carries unique benefits:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</strong> – This approach quickly discharges most unsecured debts, such as credit card balances, medical bills, and personal loans. If your income falls below the Arizona median or you pass the <em>Means Test</em>, you may qualify. While certain non-exempt assets could be liquidated, most filers use Arizona’s generous exemptions to keep essential property, like their home and primary vehicle. Chapter 7 typically concludes in three to six months, offering a faster path to a financial reset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</strong> – Known as a “wage earner’s plan,” Chapter 13 allows you to repay overdue debts through a structured plan spanning three to five years. You’ll keep your assets—including your home—while gradually catching up on missed payments. This option is often chosen by individuals whose incomes exceed the threshold for Chapter 7 or those who have significant equity in real estate or other property they wish to protect.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Who Qualifies for Bankruptcy in Chandler?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Before you begin, it’s essential to determine if you meet the requirements for **Chapter 7** or **Chapter 13**. Arizona employs a <em>Means Test</em> to assess whether you qualify for Chapter 7 based on household income relative to the state median. If your income exceeds this limit, or if you prefer to retain certain assets, **Chapter 13** may be the appropriate path. Our attorneys will carefully review your income, expenses, debts, and goals to recommend the right option for your situation.

        <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How do I know if I qualify for bankruptcy in Chandler?</summary>
        <p className="mt-2">
          To file for Chapter 7, you must typically pass the <strong>Arizona Means Test</strong>, which compares your household income to the state’s median. If you earn more than the state median or wish to catch up on mortgage or car payments over time, <strong>Chapter 13</strong> could be a better fit. Our attorneys can perform a thorough evaluation to advise you on the most suitable chapter.

        <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How long does bankruptcy take?</summary>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Chapter 7</strong> cases often conclude in 3-6 months, while <strong>Chapter 13</strong> sets up a repayment plan of 3-5 years. The duration depends on your filing chapter, how quickly you provide required documents, and whether any complications emerge during the case.

      <details className="border rounded-md p-4 my-4">
        <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Does filing for bankruptcy stop creditors from calling?</summary>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Yes. Once you submit your bankruptcy petition, the <em>automatic stay</em> goes into effect, compelling most creditors to halt collection efforts, lawsuits, and wage garnishments. This stay remains in place while your case progresses and can offer immense relief from constant creditor harassment.
