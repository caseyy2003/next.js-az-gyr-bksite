      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Understanding Your Bankruptcy Options</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bankruptcy is a powerful legal tool that can help you regain control over your finances. Knowing the differences between **Chapter 7** and **Chapter 13** bankruptcy is essential when deciding on the right option for your situation.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</strong> – Eliminates most unsecured debts, such as credit card balances and medical bills, offering financial relief.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</strong> – Allows individuals to restructure their debts into a manageable repayment plan, helping avoid foreclosure and repossession.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Benefits of Filing for Bankruptcy in Tempe</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bankruptcy provides immediate legal protection and financial benefits:
