        Bankruptcy can have a significant impact on your <strong>credit score</strong>, but it doesn&apos;t mark the end of your financial future. In fact, filing for bankruptcy often provides a <strong>fresh start</strong>&mdash;a chance to rebuild your credit and regain control over your finances. This article explains how different types of bankruptcy affect your credit score and offers actionable tips for rebuilding your financial health.

        Does Bankruptcy Ruin Your Credit Score?
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        While bankruptcy does affect your credit score, it isn&apos;t a permanent sentence. Many people mistakenly believe that bankruptcy will ruin their credit forever, but it actually offers an opportunity to start over. A bankruptcy filing will remain on your credit report for a set period:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</strong> &ndash; Stays on your credit report for{" "}
          <strong>10 years</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</strong> &ndash; Remains for{" "}
          <strong>7 years</strong> from the filing date.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">

          If you have <strong>excellent credit</strong> (typically 700+), the impact may be a drop of{" "}
          <strong>100 to 200 points</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          For those with lower credit scores (under 600), the change might be less dramatic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Keep in mind that every financial situation is unique, and your score will gradually improve as you adopt responsible financial habits.
