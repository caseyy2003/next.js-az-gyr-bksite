      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">The Rise and Collapse of Lehman Brothers</h2>
      <p>
        Lehman Brothers was once one of the largest investment banks in the world, with a legacy that spanned over a century.
        The firm played a major role in the financial sector, specializing in securities trading, investment banking, and wealth
        management. However, its collapse in 2008 marked one of the most significant financial failures in modern history.
      </p>
      <p>
        The downfall of Lehman Brothers was largely tied to its involvement in the subprime mortgage market. The firm had invested
        heavily in mortgage-backed securities, which turned into toxic assets when homeowners began defaulting on their loans.
        As the housing market crashed, Lehman found itself in a crisis that it could not recover from.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Key Factors That Led to the Bankruptcy</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">1. Exposure to the Mortgage Market</h3>
      <p>
        Lehman Brothers took on excessive risk by purchasing large amounts of mortgage-backed securities. As home prices declined
        and foreclosures surged, the firm’s holdings quickly lost value.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2. High Leverage and Risk</h3>
      <p>
        Lehman operated with a high leverage ratio, borrowing significantly more than it could safely sustain. This aggressive
        strategy left the company vulnerable when market conditions worsened.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">3. Investor Panic</h3>
      <p>
        As Lehman’s financial troubles became public, investor confidence plummeted. Stock prices tumbled, and potential buyers
        backed out of acquisition talks, further sealing the company’s fate.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">4. Lack of Government Intervention</h3>
      <p>
        While other institutions received government-backed bailouts, Lehman Brothers did not. The lack of emergency support left
        the firm with no option but to file for bankruptcy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Global Impact of the Bankruptcy</h2>
      <p>
        The collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a chain reaction that affected financial institutions worldwide. Some of the
        immediate consequences included:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
        <li>Sharp declines in global stock markets.</li>
        <li>Liquidity crises among major banks and financial institutions.</li>
        <li>Massive government bailouts to prevent economic collapse.</li>
        <li>Record levels of unemployment and widespread business closures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Lessons from the 2008 Financial Crisis</h2>
      <p>
        The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers underscored the dangers of unchecked speculation and inadequate risk management. In response,
        financial regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act were introduced to prevent similar crises in the future.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        More than a decade later, the financial crisis of 2008 remains a reminder of the importance of responsible lending, risk assessment,
        and regulatory oversight. While Lehman Brothers is no more, its collapse reshaped the global economy in ways that continue to influence
        markets today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding financial crises can help individuals and businesses navigate economic uncertainty. If you are facing financial hardship,
        consulting with a bankruptcy attorney can provide clarity on available solutions.
