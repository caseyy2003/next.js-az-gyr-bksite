      {/* Introduction */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Bankruptcy Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Bankruptcy is a legal avenue designed to help individuals overcome overwhelming debts, either
        by completely eliminating certain obligations or reorganizing them into a repayment plan{" "}
        <sup>[1]</sup>. While both <strong>Chapter 7</strong> and <strong>Chapter 13</strong> operate
        under federal law, their processes and outcomes differ in significant ways. Understanding the
        contrasts between these two chapters can help you determine which route is better suited to
        your financial situation.
      </p>

      {/* Chapter 7 Overview */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: Quick Relief</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Often referred to as “liquidation” bankruptcy, Chapter 7
          allows qualifying individuals to erase most unsecured debt, such as credit card balances
          and medical bills, relatively quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Prospective filers must pass a “means test,” which assesses
          whether their income falls below the median level in their state. If it does, they are more
          likely to be eligible <sup>[2]</sup>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asset Considerations:</strong> A court-appointed trustee reviews assets. Any
          non-exempt possessions may be sold to repay creditors. However, many debtors find most of
          their assets fall within state or federal exemptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timeline:</strong> Chapter 7 cases can often conclude in three to six months,
          offering a faster resolution compared to other bankruptcy types.
        </li>
      </ul>

      {/* Chapter 13 Overview */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Chapter 13 Bankruptcy: Structured Repayment</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Chapter 13 reorganizes debts under a court-approved plan,
          usually spanning three to five years <sup>[3]</sup>. Filers make monthly payments based on
          their disposable income.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eligibility:</strong> This option is generally suited for individuals who exceed
          the income threshold for Chapter 7 or wish to preserve certain assets. You must demonstrate
          a stable income to handle regular payments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asset Protection:</strong> Debtors retain their property as long as they adhere to
          the repayment schedule. This can be particularly advantageous for those behind on mortgage
          or car payments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timeline:</strong> Because it involves a longer payout period, Chapter 13
          necessitates a more extended commitment. Upon successful completion, remaining eligible
          debts can be discharged.
        </li>
      </ul>

      {/* Major Distinctions */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Major Differences at a Glance</h2>
      <p>
        One of the primary contrasts between <strong>Chapter 7</strong> and <strong>Chapter 13</strong>{" "}
        is the approach to debts and assets. Chapter 7 aims for a quicker discharge but may require
        liquidating certain non-exempt property. Chapter 13 involves a more prolonged process,
        granting debtors the opportunity to hold onto most, if not all, of their assets, provided they
        consistently follow the court-approved repayment plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy can appear on a credit report for up to 10 years, whereas
        Chapter 13 usually remains for up to seven years <sup>[4]</sup>. Despite this, both forms of
        bankruptcy serve as a powerful financial reset, offering relief from creditor actions and a
        chance to restore long-term financial health.
      </p>

      {/* Conclusion */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Deciding between <strong>Chapter 7</strong> and <strong>Chapter 13</strong> bankruptcy is a
        critical choice that hinges on factors like your income, types of debt, and long-term
        financial objectives. Consulting an experienced <strong>bankruptcy attorney</strong> is
        essential for evaluating your eligibility and safeguarding your assets. By choosing the most
        suitable chapter, you can take a decisive step toward debt relief and renewed financial
        stability.
