      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Understanding Your Bankruptcy Options</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bankruptcy isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s crucial to understand the nuances between **Chapter 7** and **Chapter 13** before you decide which route suits your circumstances. Both chapters can offer substantial relief, but they function differently:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</strong> – Chapter 7 is designed to wipe out certain types of unsecured debt, such as credit card balances and medical bills. In many cases, this process can conclude within a few months, giving you a chance at a swift fresh start. While Arizona exemptions can protect your home, car, and other essential property to a degree, Chapter 7 works best for those with limited disposable income.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</strong> – Chapter 13 helps individuals with a steady income manage their debts over three to five years. By consolidating arrears into an affordable repayment plan, you can catch up on missed mortgage payments, avoid foreclosure, and maintain assets that might otherwise be at risk. This makes Chapter 13 a powerful tool for homeowners and people with valuable property.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Benefits of Filing for Bankruptcy in Mesa</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you’re a Mesa resident weighed down by persistent debt, filing for bankruptcy can have immediate and long-term advantages:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Automatic Stay Protection</strong> – From the moment you file, creditors must halt most collection actions, including wage garnishments, lawsuits, and continual phone calls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoiding Foreclosure</strong> – If your home is at risk, bankruptcy can temporarily pause foreclosure, giving you time to explore repayment options or loan modifications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Guarding Against Repossession</strong> – For individuals concerned about losing their vehicle, the bankruptcy process may provide a way to reorganize payments and keep crucial transportation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Debt Discharge</strong> – Qualifying debts are ultimately wiped out, allowing you a genuine opportunity to rebuild your finances and credit profile.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stress Relief</strong> – Ending collection calls and creditor harassment can offer a clear mental space, letting you focus on recovery and planning for a stable financial future.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Who Qualifies for Bankruptcy?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In Arizona, qualifying for **Chapter 7** generally depends on passing a <em>Means Test</em>, which compares your household income to the state median. If your income falls below the threshold, you’re more likely to qualify. Meanwhile, **Chapter 13** demands a regular stream of income so you can sustain monthly payments under a structured plan. Whether you’re running a small business in downtown Mesa or commuting for work in Phoenix, our team will carefully assess your finances, debts, and assets to determine your eligibility.
