      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Understanding Your Bankruptcy Options</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bankruptcy can help individuals eliminate or restructure debt. Understanding the difference between **Chapter 7** and **Chapter 13** bankruptcy is crucial when considering your options.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</strong> – A process that eliminates most unsecured debts, such as credit card balances and medical bills, giving you a financial reset.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</strong> – Allows individuals with regular income to develop a structured repayment plan, preventing foreclosure and repossession.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Who Qualifies for Bankruptcy in Goodyear?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To file for **Chapter 7**, you must pass a **Means Test**, which compares your income to the Arizona state median. **Chapter 13** is available for those with regular income who want to repay debts under court supervision. Our attorneys assess eligibility and guide clients through the process.
