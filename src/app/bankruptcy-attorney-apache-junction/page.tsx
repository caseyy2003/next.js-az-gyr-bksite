      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Understanding Your Bankruptcy Options</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bankruptcy is a legal solution that can help individuals eliminate or restructure debt. Understanding the difference between 
        <strong> Chapter 7 </strong> and <strong> Chapter 13 </strong> bankruptcy can help you make an informed decision.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</strong> – Eliminates most unsecured debts, such as credit card balances and medical bills, giving you a financial reset.</li>
        <li><strong>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</strong> – Allows individuals with regular income to develop a structured repayment plan, preventing foreclosure and repossession.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Who Qualifies for Bankruptcy in Apache Junction?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To file for <strong>Chapter 7</strong>, you must pass a <strong>Means Test</strong>, which compares your income to the Arizona state median.
        <strong> Chapter 13 </strong> is available for those with regular income who want to repay debts under court supervision. Our attorneys assess eligibility and guide clients through the process.
